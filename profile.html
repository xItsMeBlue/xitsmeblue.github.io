    <h1>Who am I?</h1>
    <p>
        Heyo, I'm Claire, friends can call me Blue. <br><br>
        I'm currently 19 years old, my birthday will be on the 13th of January. <br>
        I live in Sluiskil with my boyfriend, we moved there past May, currently we're still working on finishing the house.<br>
        I like to do art, artsy stuff we call it. Next to that I like to play games and stuff. The art I make mostly consists of character art, likely of me and my bf's oc.
        I have a dream to start commissions some day so I can start earning money with my art. Since I like to create so much, I wanted to join the ICT study so I can learn to code 
        and make use in my creativity by developing code and software. I'm very excited to start this year.
    </p>
